i = 0                  Initializing the value of i
while i < 3:           Condition for the while loop
    print("meow")      Action to be taken in the while loop
    i += 1             The condition if fulfilled what to test next 


This is the format for the while loop in any language.
While loop is for the cases when we want the action to take place until a specific condition has been completed.
